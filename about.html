                    its scholastic achievements  and  community services is indebted of its existence 
                    to a golden-hearted man, Don Pastor  Constantino of Polo, Valenzuela City. His 
                    generous gestures of donating the 3,000 square meters of land to the Augustinian 
                    Sisters of the Philippines (ASP) now Augustinian Sisters of Our Lady  of  Consolacion  
                    (ASOLC)  in  his  newly  developed  Malinta  Villages  Subdivision  in 1963, marked  
                    the beginning of a relevant institution that was to become the instrument  of  God 
                    to sow the seeds of living faith of the compassionate Christ in a community of friends.</p>

                The school’s humble beginning fell  into the hands of  Sr. Maria Pilar Prospero, OSA, the first religious Community Superior, 
                together with Sr. Victoria Dormido,  Sr. Matilde Cuevas, and Sr. Ma. Dolores  dela  Coronacion,   the  pioneers  to  undertake  
                the  education  of  the  first  thirty  -  five kindergarten pupils form the surrounding community.

            <p style="font-size:200%">
                On October 28, 1964 during the feast day of  St. Jude Thaddeus, the papers of donation were turned - over to the  ASP, and it was 
                on the same year that the school acquired officially the name St.  Jude  Academy.  Sr. Simpliciana  de  San  Agustin,  the  first  
                school  principal worked on the school  permit  and  subsequent  recognition.  As school being run by Religious, the parents were 
                motivated to send their children to the first Catholic school in Valenzuela.

                The  school  year  1966  to  1969,  SJA  experienced  a  change  of  administration  under the leadership of Sr. Manuela del Redentor, OSA. 
                The Private Schools Athletic Association (PRISAA) of Bulacan Catholic Schools recognized  St. Jude Academy as an outstanding Catholic 
                institution where  athletics  had  a  place  in  its  curriculum. In the school year 1969-1970 another change of stewardship  took  place  
                with  Sr. Ma.  Soledad Eamilao, OSA  as Sister Superior-Principal.

            <p style="font-size:200%">
                More inputs in the field of academics became evident; the physical, moral and social spheres were also strengthened.  In  the  same  year,  
                the  organization of different student Assemblies, parent, and Alumni followed. For the school’s physical structures, the following were attained: 
                the cementing of the  entire  school  ground,  the construction of the stage,  the  half south portion of the  Sto. Niño building, and the improvement 
                of the Science Laboratory and acquisition of equipment.

                <p style="font-size:200%"> A re-shuffle of the school administrators took effect at the start of the school year 1978-1979 with  Sr.  Flor  Cordis,  
                    OSA  as  the  School  Directress,  and  at  the  same  time  the  Religious Coordinator,  Sr.  Mercedes  Rivera,  OSA  as  the  High School principal 
                    and Sr. Eduarda de San Jose, OSA the Grade School principal. The process of development and expansion had continued since then, an indication of the Academy’s 
                    commitment to meet the growing needs of the student population and to further upgrade its academic standard.

                In line with the Congregation acceptance of the Catholic School Systems Development (CS-SD), the teachers went through the Preparatory Orientation  
                Talk  on   the program where improvements in the nine areas of school operation were given emphasis. Seminars about the program went on for almost 
                three years.  In 1981, the school came up with the basic education program  (BED)  whereby a gradual transition of only one school principal for both 
                grade school and high school departments was adopted.

                This was also the time when the school’s Board of Trustees  (BOT)  started to function.  Sr. Mercedes Rivera,  OSA took over the  principalship.  
                “Setting goal”  had been the very words of  Sr. Teresita Villaluz,  OSA, the community coordinator in 1983.  Through her motivation and creativity, together 
                with Sr. Mercedes, the  school  underwent  the  First  Congregational  Evaluation  Visit   (CEV I).   As   a   result,  the Academy’s program had to focus 
                more in the areas of Faculty,  Instruction and Administration.  In the year 1983-1984,  Sr. Ermelinda Sales, OSA was assigned as the new principal.  She 
                managed the school for a year due to the fast turnover of the personnel in the Congregation.

                In  consonance  with the achievement of relevant education and the articulation of the Charism and  Mission  Statement  of  the  Congregation, a dynamic 
                and seasoned academician – educator came by the school 1984-1985 in the person of Sr. Adelina Segismundo, OSA. A thorough review of  the  highlights  and  
                recommendations  of  the  CEV I  gave  a  new  direction  to the goals and objectives   of   the   school.   The  following  became  more evident;  
                Outreach  Program  through catechetical instruction in the nearby public school: jail visitation by students, teachers, and non-teaching personnel:  
                rapport between  the  home  and  the  school  was  strengthened;  continuing growth and development of the teaching staff through seminar - workshops  
                and attendance  in the graduate school. Before the school year 1987-1988 started another sister - administrator  came in, Sr.  Natividad Varela, OSA 
                as the new principal.

            <p style="font-size:200%">
                More promising projects were at hand in line with the  institution’s  celebration  of  its  Silver Jubilee.  At the disclose of 
                the 90’s February 11,  St. Jude Academy celebrated its 25th  years of existence with the theme of “SJA’s 25th years of Service  for  Christian  
                Value - Oriented Formation”.  This was the same year when the school attained  its  program  for  building  expansion  due  to  the increase in 
                the students and personnel population.  In the school 1990 - 1991,  another  change  of  administration  took  place, Sr. Maria Annunciata Piella, 
                OSA was assigned to be the principal.  The ground–breaking of the north–wing portion of the main building (now Mother Rita building) ended her 
                term of office.

                    Management  (TQM)  of  Sr. Francisca Montesa, OSA as the new principal, SJA gathered enough courage and determination to work for voluntary 
                    accreditation.  On February 14 - 15,  1994,  the  school  successfully  passed  the  Congregational  Evaluation  Visit  (CEV II). Because  of  
                    the  fast  turn - over  of  personnel in the Congregation,  school year 1995 - 1996  Sr. Rosalinda B. Bayla, OSA came in as the new school

                in that year up to 1999 had proven the veracity of  the Congregation’s  appointment  through  the improvements  undertaken in the physical plant.
